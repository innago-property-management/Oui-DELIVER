# Kaizen Sweep Configuration
# Repos are swept in a staggered fashion based on hour-of-week
# Add/remove repos from active_repos to control which get swept

# Sweep settings
settings:
  # How many repos to sweep per dispatch (per hour when scheduled)
  repos_per_hour: 1
  # Only sweep during these hours (UTC) - avoids overnight sweeps
  # Set to null to sweep any hour
  active_hours: [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]
  # Days to sweep (0=Monday, 6=Sunday) - null for all days
  active_days: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]  # Monday-Friday
  # Require this topic on repos for sweeps to be dispatched (opt-in mechanism)
  # Set to null to sweep all repos in active_repos regardless of topics
  require_topic: "kaizen-enabled"

# Active repositories to sweep
# Order matters - repos are selected based on (hour_index % total_repos)
# ~50 repos @ 1/hour = full cycle every ~50 hours (~1 sweep/repo/week)
